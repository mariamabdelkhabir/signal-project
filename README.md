The uploaded file is for lie wave classification steps , including feature extraction from already filtered (preprocessed signals). The feature extraction was by OSW (overlapping sliding window) with applying of DWT (discrete wavelet transform) to decompose the signal into 4 levels and statistical methods (mean , median , min ,max,....) then labeling the truth and lie wave and collecting all features togather to be entered into the LSTM model (long-short term memory) , after training the model we have evaluated it to get the accuracy of the train 0.62 then we have got the confusion matrix to get (true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative) and the sensitivity have been computed to be 0.7082, Specificity is 0.5371, Precision is 0.5978 and F1-score is 0.6484, Then we have plot the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve to evaluate the performance of the classification model.
